## Getting Started with Git

This document provides an introduction to Git version control system for data science projects. If you are new to Git, this guide will help you get started with the basics of Git and its terminology.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your files and collaborate with others on projects. Git keeps a history of all changes to a project, making it easy to revert to previous versions or collaborate with others on the same project.

## Installing Git

To get started with Git, you'll need to install it on your computer. Git is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. You can download Git from the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

After you have downloaded Git, you can check if it's installed correctly by opening a terminal window and typing `git --version`. If Git is installed, the version number will be displayed in the terminal.
