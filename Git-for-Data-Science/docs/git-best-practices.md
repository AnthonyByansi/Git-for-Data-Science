# Git Best Practices

Version control systems are essential for any DataScience  project, and Git has become the de facto standard in recent years. However, using Git effectively requires some best practices to be followed, to avoid common pitfalls and ensure a smooth development process.

Here are some advanced Git best practices to take your workflow to the next level.

1. Use Git Hooks
Git hooks allow you to run custom scripts before or after certain Git actions, such as committing, pushing, or merging. This can be useful for enforcing coding standards, running automated tests, or generating documentation. You can find many pre-written hooks on GitHub, or write your own to suit your project's needs.
