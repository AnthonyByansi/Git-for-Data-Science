# Git Best Practices

Version control systems are essential for any DataScience  project, and Git has become the de facto standard in recent years. However, using Git effectively requires some best practices to be followed, to avoid common pitfalls and ensure a smooth development process.

Here are some advanced Git best practices to take your workflow to the next level.

1. Use Git Hooks
Git hooks allow you to run custom scripts before or after certain Git actions, such as committing, pushing, or merging. This can be useful for enforcing coding standards, running automated tests, or generating documentation. You can find many pre-written hooks on GitHub, or write your own to suit your project's needs.

To set up a Git hook, create a script in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository and make it executable.
**For example, to run a pre-commit hook that checks the code for syntax errors using `eslint`, create a file called `.git/hooks/pre-commit` with the following content:**

```bash
#!/bin/sh
npm run lint
```
Then make it executable with the following command: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
Now, every time you try to commit changes, the `npm run lint` command will be run automatically, and the commit will be aborted if there are any syntax errors.

2. Use Git aliases
Git aliases allow you to create custom shortcuts for frequently used Git commands. This can save you a lot of time and typing, especially for complex commands with many arguments. You can set up aliases for any Git command, or even for custom scripts or external commands.

To set up a Git alias, use the `git config` command with the `alias.<name>` syntax, where `<name>` is the name of your alias.
For example, to create an alias called `s` for the `status` command, run the following command:`git config --global alias.s status`
