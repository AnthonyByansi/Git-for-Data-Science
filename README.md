## Why Use Git for Data Science?

Git is a powerful tool for version control, allowing you to track changes to your code and collaborate with others effectively. In the context of data science, Git is particularly useful because it allows you to version control not only your code but also your data, ensuring that you can always reproduce your analysis and results.


## Getting Started with Git

If you're new to Git, this section will cover everything you need to get started. We'll cover topics like how to install Git, creating a new Git repository, and the key Git commands like `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit`. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid foundation in Git and be ready to move on to more advanced topics.


## Git Branching and Merging

Once you're comfortable with the basics of Git, you'll want to learn how to use branching and merging effectively. Branching allows you to create independent lines of development, so you can work on features or issues without affecting the main codebase. Merging allows you to bring those changes back into the main codebase once they're complete. In this section, we'll cover how to create and manage branches in Git, as well as how to merge changes from one branch to another.

## Collaborating with Git

Using Git effectively in a team environment requires some additional skills beyond just branching and merging. In this section, we'll cover topics like how to collaborate on code changes, how to use Git to review code, and how to manage conflicts that arise when two people make changes to the same code at the same time.
